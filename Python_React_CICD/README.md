# Python & React CICD Project

This project provides a comprehensive guide to setting up a **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CICD)** pipeline for a Python and React application. The guide is broken down into several key sections, covering everything from initial server setup to automated deployments using various DevOps tools.

## 1. Server - Virtual Machine Setup in VirtualBox üíª

This section details the precise, step-by-step process of creating and configuring a virtual machine (VM) in **Oracle VM VirtualBox**. This VM will serve as our development and deployment environment.

### 1.1. Preparation

First, you need to download the necessary software:

* **CentOS Stream 10 ISO:** Download the `x86_64` ISO image from the official CentOS website.
* **Oracle VirtualBox:** Download and install the latest version for your operating system.

### 1.2. Configure Host-Only Adapter (if absent)

To allow the host machine to communicate with the VM, we need to set up a dedicated private network.

1.  Open VirtualBox, go to **File > Tools > Network Manager**.
2.  Select **Host-only Networks** and add a new one if it doesn't exist.
3.  Configure the settings as follows:
    * **Adapter Tab:**
        * **IPv4 Address:** `192.168.56.1`
        * **IPv4 Network Mask:** `255.255.255.0`
    * **DHCP Server Tab:**
        * Enable **Server**.
        * **Server Address:** `192.168.56.100`
        * **Server Mask:** `255.255.255.0`
        * **Lower Address Bound:** `192.168.56.101`
        * **Upper Address Bound:** `192.168.56.254`

After configuring the adapter, **reboot your machine** to ensure the changes take effect.

### 1.3. VM Creation

Now, let's create the virtual machine.

1.  In VirtualBox, go to **Machine > New**.
2.  **Name and Operation System:**
    * **Name:** `DevOps_Server`
    * **ISO Image:** Select the downloaded CentOS Stream 10 ISO.
    * **Type:** `Linux`
    * **Version:** `Red Hat (64-bit)`
    * Check `Skip Unattended Installation`.
3.  **Hardware:**
    * **Base Memory (RAM):** `8192 MB` (8 GB)
    * **Processors:** `4`
4.  **Hard Disk:**
    * **Create a Virtual Hard Disk Now**.
    * **File Location:** Set it to your desired folder.
    * **Size:** `80 GB`

### 1.4. Network Setup in VirtualBox

Before starting the installation, configure the network adapters for the VM.

1.  Right-click on the `DevOps_Server` VM and select **Settings > Network**.
2.  **Adapter 1:** Leave this enabled and set to **NAT**. This provides internet access for the VM.
3.  **Adapter 2:** Enable this adapter and set it to **Host-only Adapter**. This allows communication with the host machine.

### 1.5. CentOS Installation and Network Configuration

Start the VM to begin the CentOS installation process.

1.  Click **Start** to run the VM and select **Install CentOS Stream 10**.
2.  Choose your preferred language for the installation (**English** is recommended).
3.  On the **Installation Summary** screen, configure the following:
    * **Keyboard:** `English`
    * **Language Support:** `English`
    * **Time & Date:** Select your time zone, e.g., `Europe/Warsaw`.
    * **Installation Source:** The system should auto-detect the downloaded ISO.
    * **Software Selection:** Choose `Server`.
    * **Installation Destination:** Select the 80 GB disk.
4.  Configure the **Network & Host Name**:
    * Enable the `enp0s3` interface to get a dynamic IP address via NAT.
    * Select the **`enp0s8`** interface (this is your Host-only adapter).
    * Click **Configure** then IPv4 Settings, select **Manual** and set a **Static IP address**:
        * **Address:** `192.168.56.101`
        * **Netmask:** `255.255.255.0`
        * **Gateway:** `192.168.56.1`
        * **DNS:** `8.8.8.8`
5.  **User Settings:**
    * Set the **Root Password** (or choose to disable it).
    * Create a new user, e.g., `peter`, and set a strong password.
6.  Click **Begin Installation**.
7.  Once the installation is complete, click **Reboot System**.

---
### 1.6. System Update and SSH Connection

Once the VM has rebooted, log in and perform a system update and test your SSH connection.

1.  **Update Packages:** Run the following commands to update the kernel and packages.
    ```bash
    sudo dnf update -y
    ```
2.  **Check Versions:** Verify the installed kernel version.
    ```bash
    uname -r
    ```
3.  **Connect via SSH:** From your host machine, you can now connect to the VM.
    ```bash
    ssh peter@192.168.56.101
    ```
    If you encounter a `REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED` error, you can fix it by removing the old key from your `known_hosts` file.
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -f '/home/peter/.ssh/known_hosts' -R '192.168.56.101'
    ```

### 1.7. Final Step: Snapshot

To avoid repeating these steps, it's highly recommended to save the machine state.

1.  In VirtualBox, go to **Machine > Take Snapshot**.
2.  Name the snapshot (e.g., `Initial Setup`) and provide a brief description.

This completes the foundational setup for our DevOps server.
